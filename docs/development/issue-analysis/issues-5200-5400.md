## Issue [#5217](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/issues/5217): Splitting existing transaction causes UI glitches
**Priority: ⭐⭐⭐ (Very Easy)**  
**Labels:** bug, good first issue, help wanted, user interface  
**Opened:** Jul 20, 2024 (1+ months old)

### Problem
When splitting an existing transaction into multiple sub-transactions, the UI experiences glitches where split transactions disappear and reappear during editing, creating a confusing user experience.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Create a transaction as a non-split transaction
2. Edit the transaction category to turn it into a split transaction  
3. Enter the first split amount, press Enter
4. Observe glitchy UI behavior where splits disappear and reappear
5. Notice that a 0.00 split transaction remains after completing the split

### Technical Analysis
- **Files affected:** 
  - `packages/desktop-client/src/components/transactions/TransactionList.tsx:218-229`
  - `packages/loot-core/src/shared/transactions.ts:226-243` 
- **Current issue:** Multiple state updates causing UI flicker
- **Root cause:** The `onAddSplit` function performs two state updates:
  1. Immediate optimistic update: `onChange(changes.newTransaction, changes.data)` (line 219)
  2. Server response update: `saveDiffAndApply(changes.diff, ...)` (lines 220-225)

### Solution
```typescript
// In TransactionList.tsx, lines 216-229
const onAddSplit = useCallback(
  (id: TransactionEntity['id']) => {
    const changes = addSplitTransaction(transactionsLatest.current, id);
    // Remove immediate onChange call to prevent double update
    // onChange(changes.newTransaction, changes.data);
    saveDiffAndApply(
      changes.diff,
      changes,
      onChange,
      isLearnCategoriesEnabled,
    );
    return changes.diff.added[0].id;
  },
  [isLearnCategoriesEnabled, onChange],
);
```

### Verification
- [How to verify the fix works]
- Test splitting transactions and ensure no flickering occurs
- Verify that no 0.00 amount splits remain after completion
- Check that split functionality still works correctly

### Code Areas Affected
- `packages/desktop-client/src/components/transactions/TransactionList.tsx:218`

### Complexity Rating: 2/10
- Single line removal (commenting out the immediate onChange call)
- Clear understanding of the double-update problem
- Low regression risk since saveDiffAndApply already handles the update properly

## Issue [#5287](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/issues/5287): Add report options translations
**Priority: ⭐⭐ (Easy)**  
**Labels:** tech debt, translations  
**Opened:** Jun 15, 2024 (2+ months old)

### Problem
Some report option strings in the defaultReport object are hardcoded in English and not marked for translation, preventing proper internationalization.

### Technical Analysis
- **File affected:** `packages/desktop-client/src/components/reports/ReportOptions.ts:14-34`
- **Current code:** Hardcoded English strings in defaultReport object
- **Issue:** Several properties lack `t()` translation wrapper

### Solution
```typescript
// Before (lines 20-31)
export const defaultReport: CustomReportEntity = {
  id: '',
  name: '',
  startDate,
  endDate,
  isDateStatic: false,
  dateRange: 'Last 6 months',
  mode: 'total',
  groupBy: 'Category', 
  interval: 'Monthly',
  balanceType: 'Payment',
  sortBy: 'desc',
  showEmpty: false,
  showOffBudget: false,
  showHiddenCategories: false,
  includeCurrentInterval: true,
  showUncategorized: false,
  graphType: 'BarGraph',
  conditions: [],
  conditionsOp: 'and',
};

// After - Wrap strings with t() function
export const defaultReport: CustomReportEntity = {
  id: '',
  name: '',
  startDate,
  endDate,
  isDateStatic: false,
  dateRange: t('Last 6 months'),
  mode: t('total'),
  groupBy: t('Category'),
  interval: t('Monthly'), 
  balanceType: t('Payment'),
  sortBy: t('desc'),
  showEmpty: false,
  showOffBudget: false,
  showHiddenCategories: false,
  includeCurrentInterval: true,
  showUncategorized: false,
  graphType: t('BarGraph'),
  conditions: [],
  conditionsOp: t('and'),
};
```

### Code Areas Affected
- `packages/desktop-client/src/components/reports/ReportOptions.ts:20-31`

### Complexity Rating: 2/10
- Multiple simple string wrapping changes
- Translation infrastructure already imported (`import { t } from 'i18next';`)
- Clear pattern to follow from existing translations in the same file

## Issue [#5300](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/issues/5300): Account name doesn't reset when adding multiple transactions on mobile
**Priority: ⭐⭐ (Easy)**  
**Labels:** bug, user interface, responsive  
**Opened:** May 26, 2024 (3+ months old)

### Problem
On mobile, when adding multiple transactions using the "+" button, the account field retains the value from the previous transaction instead of being reset, causing user confusion.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Open Actual Budget on Android/mobile
2. Add a new transaction using the "+" icon at the bottom
3. Select an account and complete the transaction
4. Go back and hit the "+" icon again
5. Notice the account name from the previous transaction is still selected

### Technical Analysis
- **File affected:** `packages/desktop-client/src/components/mobile/transactions/TransactionEdit.jsx:1163`
- **Current code:** `locationState?.accountId || lastTransaction?.account || null`
- **Issue:** Uses `lastTransaction?.account` as fallback, causing account persistence across new transactions

### Solution
```javascript
// Before (line 1163)
makeTemporaryTransactions(
  locationState?.accountId || lastTransaction?.account || null,
  locationState?.categoryId || null,
  lastTransaction?.date,
),

// After - Remove lastTransaction?.account fallback for account field  
makeTemporaryTransactions(
  locationState?.accountId || null,
  locationState?.categoryId || null,
  lastTransaction?.date,
),
```

### Code Areas Affected
- `packages/desktop-client/src/components/mobile/transactions/TransactionEdit.jsx:1163`

### Complexity Rating: 1/10
- Single line change removing account persistence
- Clear problem with obvious solution
- Low regression risk

## Issue [#5370](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/issues/5370): Can't filter by payee for closed accounts
**Priority: ⭐⭐ (Easy)**  
**Labels:** bug, transactions, user interface  
**Opened:** Apr 15, 2024 (4+ months old)

### Problem
When trying to filter transactions by payee, closed accounts don't appear in the "suggested payees" dropdown, making it impossible to filter historical transfers from/to closed accounts.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Create two accounts, add some dummy transactions and close one of them
2. Go to the All Accounts page  
3. Open Filter -> Payee
4. Search for the closed account - it's not listed
5. Compare with Filter -> Account where closed accounts ARE listed

### Technical Analysis
- **File affected:** `packages/desktop-client/src/queries/queriesSlice.ts:918-924`
- **Current code:** `getActivePayees` function filters out transfer payees for closed accounts
- **Issue:** Line 921 excludes payees where `!account.closed`

### Solution
```typescript
// Before (lines 918-924)
return payees.filter(payee => {
  if (payee.transfer_acct) {
    const account = accountsById[payee.transfer_acct];
    return account != null && !account.closed;
  }
  return true;
});

// After - Allow closed account transfer payees in filter contexts
return payees.filter(payee => {
  if (payee.transfer_acct) {
    const account = accountsById[payee.transfer_acct];
    return account != null; // Remove closed account restriction
  }
  return true;
});
```

**Alternative Solution:** Add a context parameter to `getActivePayees` to differentiate between filtering contexts (where closed accounts should be shown) and transaction entry contexts (where they shouldn't).

### Code Areas Affected
- `packages/desktop-client/src/queries/queriesSlice.ts:921`

### Complexity Rating: 2/10
- Single line change to remove closed account filter
- May need consideration of where this function is used to avoid showing closed accounts in inappropriate contexts
- Clear problem with straightforward solution
