## 🚀 **Quick Decision Tree**

### **What are you working on?**

**🎨 Frontend/UI Changes?**
→ Read `desktop-client-deep-dive.md` TL;DR section
→ Full doc if working with: budget components, modals, mobile UI

**🧠 Backend/Business Logic?**
→ Read `loot-core-deep-dive.md` TL;DR section  
→ Full doc if working with: database, API endpoints, calculations

**🔗 Integration/Full-Stack?**
→ Read `package-relationships-mapping.md` TL;DR section
→ Full doc if building features that cross frontend ↔ backend

**📋 General Understanding?**
→ Read `actual-project-structure-analysis.md` overview section
→ Skip if you already understand monorepo structure

## ⚡ **30-Second Architecture Summary**

```
Frontend (desktop-client)     Backend (loot-core)        Database
├── React Components         ├── Business Logic         ├── SQLite
├── 406 TSX files           ├── 134 TS files           ├── CRDT Sync
├── Budget/Account UI       ├── API Endpoints          └── Local-first
└── State Management        └── Calculations/Rules          
```

**Key Integration:** Message-based API (`send('action', data)`) between frontend ↔ backend

## 📚 **Detailed Document Summaries**

### 1. `actual-project-structure-analysis.md`
**📏 Size:** Medium (2,500 words)  
**🎯 Focus:** Monorepo structure, package purposes, C# developer analogies
**💡 Best for:** Understanding overall architecture, first-time contributors
**⚠️ Skip if:** You already know the 8-package structure and their roles

### 2. `loot-core-deep-dive.md`  
**📏 Size:** Large (3,000 words)
**🎯 Focus:** Business logic engine - budget/, db/, transactions/, api.ts modules
**💡 Best for:** Backend development, database changes, API modifications
**⚠️ Skip if:** Only working on frontend UI components

**Key Modules:**
- `server/budget/` - Budget calculations (60K+ lines)
- `server/db/` - Database operations (25K+ lines) 
- `server/api.ts` - API endpoints (20K+ lines)
- `server/transactions/` - Transaction processing (35K+ lines)

### 3. `desktop-client-deep-dive.md`
**📏 Size:** Large (3,500 words)  
**🎯 Focus:** React frontend - component architecture, state management, UI patterns  
**💡 Best for:** Frontend development, component changes, UI/UX work
**⚠️ Skip if:** Only working on backend logic

**Key Component Areas:**
- `components/budget/` - Budget interface (25 files, very high complexity)
- `components/accounts/` - Account management (8 files, very high complexity)
- `components/modals/` - Complex interactions (20 files)
- `components/mobile/` - Mobile-optimized UI (12 files)

### 4. `package-relationships-mapping.md`
**📏 Size:** Large (2,800 words)
**🎯 Focus:** Cross-package integration, data flow, API communication patterns
**💡 Best for:** Full-stack features, understanding data flow, debugging integration issues
**⚠️ Skip if:** Working within a single package only

**Key Integration Patterns:**
- Frontend ↔ Backend: Message-based API (`send('action', data)`)
- Database ↔ Sync: CRDT-based synchronization  
- State Management: Redux + React hooks

## 🔍 **Context-Efficient Reading Strategy**

### **Scenario 1: Bug Fix (UI Issue)**
1. ✅ Read this README (2 min)
2. ✅ Read `desktop-client-deep-dive.md` TL;DR (1 min)
3. 🤔 Read full doc only if working with complex components
4. ❌ Skip backend docs unless bug crosses frontend/backend

### **Scenario 2: New Feature (Full-Stack)**
1. ✅ Read this README (2 min)
2. ✅ Read all TL;DR sections (3 min)
3. ✅ Read `package-relationships-mapping.md` for integration patterns
4. 🤔 Read specific deep-dives based on implementation needs

### **Scenario 3: Database/API Work**
1. ✅ Read this README (2 min) 
2. ✅ Read `loot-core-deep-dive.md` TL;DR (1 min)
3. ✅ Read full `loot-core-deep-dive.md` for implementation details
4. ❌ Skip frontend docs unless API changes affect UI

### **Scenario 4: First-Time Understanding**
1. ✅ Read this README (2 min)
2. ✅ Read `actual-project-structure-analysis.md` overview (3 min)
3. 🤔 Skim TL;DR sections of relevant deep-dives
4. 📚 Bookmark deep-dives for when you need specific details

## 🎯 **Smart Context Usage Tips**

**Efficient Approach:**
- Always start with this README
- Read TL;DR sections first
- Only consume full docs when you need implementation details
- Use search within docs for specific topics

**Context-Heavy Approach (avoid unless necessary):**
- Reading all docs in full for simple changes
- Loading entire docs when you only need architectural understanding

## 🔧 **Quick Reference Commands**

```bash
# Find architecture docs
ls docs/development/architecture-analysis/

# Search across all architecture docs  
rg "search_term" docs/development/architecture-analysis/

# Get doc sizes
wc -w docs/development/architecture-analysis/*.md
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** This README should cover 80% of architectural questions. Only dive into detailed docs when you need specific implementation guidance or are working extensively in that area.
