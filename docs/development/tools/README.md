# Advanced Prompt Engineering for AI Development

This directory contains cutting-edge prompt engineering tools and techniques for AI-enhanced software development, specifically optimized for the Actual Budget codebase.

## üìÅ Contents

### üß† Core Documentation
- **[advanced-prompt-engineering-guide.md](./advanced-prompt-engineering-guide.md)** - Comprehensive guide to RAG, vector databases, and advanced prompting techniques
- **[README.md](./README.md)** - This overview and quick start guide

### üõ†Ô∏è Practical Tools
- **[ai-context-builder.sh](./ai-context-builder.sh)** - Unix/Linux context generation script
- **[ai-context-builder.bat](./ai-context-builder.bat)** - Windows context generation script

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Generate AI Context for Development

**Windows:**
```cmd
# Component development context
docs\development\prompt-engineering\ai-context-builder.bat component feature

# API development context  
docs\development\prompt-engineering\ai-context-builder.bat api bugfix

# Testing context
docs\development\prompt-engineering\ai-context-builder.bat testing development
```

**Unix/Linux/Git Bash:**
```bash
# Component development context
./docs/development/prompt-engineering/ai-context-builder.sh component feature

# API development context
./docs/development/prompt-engineering/ai-context-builder.sh api bugfix

# Testing context
./docs/development/prompt-engineering/ai-context-builder.sh testing development
```

### Example Usage Workflow

1. **Generate Context**: Run context builder for your focus area
2. **Copy Context**: Use generated markdown in your AI prompts
3. **Apply Techniques**: Use Tree of Thoughts and Constitutional AI approaches
4. **Iterate**: Refine based on results and document patterns

## üéØ Advanced Techniques Available

### 1. Tree of Thoughts (ToT) Prompting
Structured approach for complex development decisions:
```
Problem: [Development challenge]
Branch 1: [Approach A with analysis]
Branch 2: [Approach B with analysis]  
Evaluation: [Compare and select]
Execution: [Implement chosen approach]
```

### 2. Constitutional AI
Self-correcting prompts that check:
- TypeScript best practices
- Codebase consistency
- Security implications
- Performance impact

### 3. Meta-Prompting
Context-aware prompt generation based on:
- Current file being worked on
- Related patterns in codebase
- Dependencies and imports
- Recent changes

### 4. Semantic Code Search
Enhanced search beyond keywords:
- Pattern-based similarity
- Architectural context
- Cross-package relationships
- Implementation examples

## üîç Context Builder Features

### Focus Areas
- **component/frontend** - React component development patterns
- **api/backend** - Server-side and API development
- **testing** - Test patterns and strategies
- **integration** - Cross-package communication
- **general** - Overall project context

### Task Types
- **feature** - New feature development
- **bugfix** - Bug analysis and fixing
- **refactor** - Code refactoring guidance
- **performance** - Performance optimization
- **development** - General development

### Output Features
- Relevant code patterns from actual codebase
- File structure analysis
- Recent changes context
- Task-specific guidance
- Ready-to-use prompt templates
- Tree of Thoughts frameworks

## üß™ Integration with Existing Workflow

### With Code Examples Library
```bash
# Generate context + use existing patterns
./ai-context-builder.sh component feature component-context.md
# Then reference: docs/development/code-examples/frontend-patterns.md
```

### With Architecture Analysis
```bash
# For deep architectural understanding
./ai-context-builder.sh integration development integration-context.md
# Reference: docs/development/architecture-analysis/
```

### With CLAUDE.md Instructions
The context builder respects all constraints from CLAUDE.md:
- TypeScript strict mode
- No regression refactoring
- Small incremental changes
- C# developer analogies
- Testing requirements

## üé™ Prompt Scaffolding Examples

### Simple Task Prompt
```markdown
Context: [Generated context from tool]

Task: Add loading state to Budget component

Constraints: Follow existing patterns, maintain tests

Output: Implementation with file:line references
```

### Complex Feature Prompt (Tree of Thoughts)
```markdown
Context: [Generated context from tool]

Problem: Implement offline-first transaction sync

Approach 1: Service Worker + IndexedDB
- Pros: Browser native, reliable offline
- Cons: Complex state management
- Implementation: [steps]

Approach 2: In-memory cache + periodic sync
- Pros: Simpler state, easier debugging  
- Cons: Data loss on refresh
- Implementation: [steps]

Evaluation: [Compare against codebase patterns]
Selected: [Chosen approach with rationale]

Output: Step-by-step implementation with tests
```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Vector Database Integration** - Semantic search over codebase
2. **Auto-Context Updates** - Git hook integration
3. **Pattern Recognition** - ML-powered code similarity
4. **Multi-Modal Prompting** - Include visual diagrams

### Research Areas
- RAG optimization for code retrieval
- Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
- Query rewriting for development tasks
- Success pattern reinforcement learning

## üìä Success Metrics

Track improvement in:
- Development velocity (features per sprint)
- Code quality (lint/type errors)
- Pattern consistency
- First-attempt success rate
- Context relevance scores

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new prompt engineering techniques:

1. Document in `advanced-prompt-engineering-guide.md`
2. Add practical tools if applicable
3. Test with real development scenarios
4. Update context builder for new patterns
5. Measure and document effectiveness
